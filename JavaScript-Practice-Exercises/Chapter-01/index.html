    <h1>All Questions of Chapter 1</h1>
    <h3>Practice exercise 1.1</h3>
        <p>Working with the console:
        1. Open the browser console, type 4 + 10, and press Enter. What do you see as 
        the response?
        2. Use the console.log() syntax, placing a value within the rounded brackets. 
        Try entering your name with quotes around it (this is to indicate the fact that 
        it's a text stringâ€”we'll get to this in the next chapter).</p>
    <h3>Practice exercise 1.2</h3>
        <p>JavaScript in an HTML page:
        1. Open your code editor and create an HTML file.
        2. Within your HTML file, set up the HTML tags, doctype, HTML, head, and 
        body, and then proceed and add the script tags.
        3. Place some JavaScript code within the script tags. You can use console.
        log("hello world!").</p>
    <h3>Practice exercise 1.3</h3>
        <p>1. Create a separate file called app with the extension .js.
        2. Within the .js file, add some JavaScript code.
        3. Link to the separate .js file within the HTML file you created in Practice 
        exercise 1.2.
        4. Open the HTML file within your browser and check to see whether the 
        JavaScript code ran properly.</p>
    <h3>Practice exercise 1.4</h3>
        Adding comments:
        <p>1. Add a new statement to your JavaScript code by setting a variable value. 
        Since we will cover this in the next chapter, you can use the following line: 
        let a = 10;
        2. Add a comment at the end of the statement indicating that you set a value of 
        3. Print the value using console.log(). Add a comment explaining what this 
        4. At the end of your JavaScript code, use a multiple-line comment. In a real 
        production script, you might use this space to add a brief outline of the 
        purpose of the file.</p>
